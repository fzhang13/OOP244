Workshop 8 Reflection

1. The difference between an abstract class and a concrete class is that an abstract class is a class that contains one or more pure virtual functions whereas a concrete class will have no pure virtual functions.Concrete class are also derived class that will implement functionality for the interface while abstract class are most of the time a base class that defines an interface.

2.A few functions that shadows the functions of the same name in the workshop:

ChequeingAccount::credit() shadows the Account::credit() function.
ChequeingAccount::debit() shadows the Account::debit() function.
ChequeingAccount::monthEnd() shadows SavingsAccount::monthEnd() function.
ChequeingAccount::displa() shadows SavingsAccount::display() function.

3. In this workshop, I have learned how to properly implement derived class from their base classes and how to define abstract classes within the derived class using pure virtual functions.

#3 Correction
Abstract base class are used specifically as a base class and contains at least one pure virtual functions defined as follwing:
class Person{
public:
	virtual void display()const = 0;
};
