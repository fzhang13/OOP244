Reflection:
1. There are 41 (40 + 1 ) characters that stores the familyName and givenName because 40 characters are reserved for the name and the 1 extra character is reserved for the null terminating character.

2.Function overloading 

3.In this workshop, I learned how to correctly validate SIN number using the weighted sum method and the usage of constructors.

Quiz Reflection:

1. Correction : The member function will know which object is the current instance using the syntax "this."

2. Correction: The complier does not create the default no-argument constructor if a constructor with parameters is declared within the class.
